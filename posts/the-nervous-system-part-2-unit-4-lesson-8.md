I want to share a couple fun things for this lesson. Scroll down a bit to get to those things.

But first, Professor Dave has two very good videos explaining in detail the two main parts of the nervous system - the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. Watching these videos would be a very good alternative to reading the material in the Connexus lesson.

Now on to the fun things.

First, this is a video from TED-Ed that discusses how our nervous systems interpret the sensation of pain. This is a good example of strange and complex our nervous systems can be.eakyDiXX6Uc

I want to share an article from one of my favorite places on the internet: *Wait But Why.* 

Here's a quick excerpt from the article.

> The mind-bending bigness of Neuralink’s mission, combined with the labyrinth of impossible complexity that is the human brain, made this the hardest set of concepts yet to fully wrap my head around—but it also made it the most exhilarating when, with enough time spent zoomed on both ends, it all finally clicked. I feel like I took a time machine to the future, and I’m here to tell you that it’s even weirder than we expect (Tim Urban, Wait But Why).

If it interests you, feel free to read the whole thing: [Neuralink and the Brain's Magical Future](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink-cleanversion.html)

Fair warning - it is very long. Don't feel bad if you don't read it all in one or even five sittings. I certainly did not.

Why should you read this article? It's about what might be possible if we could combine our brains with machines. Sounds like science fiction? Yes, it certainly does. But just because something sounds like science fiction doesn't mean it isn't possible. But for any of it to be possible, we need a very good understanding of how the brain works. If these sorts of science fiction ideas sound interesting to you, then the first step is to understand the function of the nervous system
