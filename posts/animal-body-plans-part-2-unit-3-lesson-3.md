In [the previous post](/posts/animal-body-plans-part-1-unit-3-lesson-2/), Hank from Crash Course described a major difference between animals that develop a mouth and (ahem) an anus and animals that only develop a mouth/anus. The first group are called triploblastic (which includes us, thankfully) and the second group are called diploblastic. Another main difference is that triploblastic end up having three main cell layers while diploblastic only have two. Notice how most animal phyla are triploblastic.

You can see in this picture a developing triploblastic organism. You can also see what each of the cell layers (also called "germ layers) will eventually develop into.

For more about these different germ layers, you can check out this very short video from Khan Academy:

In the next few lessons we will be learning more about specific phyla within the triploblastic group. But if you are curious to learn more about sea sponges and jellyfish, check out these two videos. These would be good resources to use for your upcoming portfolio as well!
