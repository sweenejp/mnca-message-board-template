Since you've taken Biology this year, you have the fortunate opportunity to understand how the COVID-19 vaccines work. In particular, we are going to learn more about the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. If you remember learning about the role of mRNA in our own cells and bodies, you might already have a good guess at how these vaccines work.

But first, I want to say something rather heartfelt. One of the main reasons I decided to become a science teacher was so that I could share how to think like a scientist. The world is filled with misinformation and sometimes even outright lies. For example, during a pandemic [some people may even try to sell you bogus miracle cures.](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200730/fda-warns-of-silver-other-bogus-covid-cures) Understanding science and knowing how to think like a scientist protects you from misinformation and lies.

On the other hand, sometimes people simply have misconceptions about scientific things. Unlike lies, people with misconceptions don't *intend* to spread falsehoods. But misconceptions can still be harmful. Which brings us to the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. If you have a fairly basic understanding of the biology, you can avoid falling for misconceptions about these vaccines. You *can understand* how these vaccines work. You have learned about cells, viruses, DNA, and RNA. And just last lesson you've learned a bit about the immune system. Understanding how something works, such as a vaccine, helps blast away misconceptions and spot lies. This is why science is important.

Okay, that's the end of my heartfelt section. On to learning about the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19.

The first video I want to share with you explains *how* the mRNA vaccines work. Why and how do these vaccines protect us from contracting and spreading COVID-19?

As you saw in the above video, the vaccine is simple... yet amazing. The vaccine is just a set of instructions for making a small part of the coronavirus! As one Youtube commenter put it "so basically you don't need the whole enemy to train your soldiers only show them what the enemy's weapon look like."

This next video explains how the mRNA vaccines were developed. If you don't have time to watch all the videos, I'd suggest skipping this one. But if you have the chance to watch it, go for it. This video explains in particular how researchers were able to develop the vaccine so quickly.

Maybe that video will inspire you to go into a career in Bio-technology. 

This last video is my favorite. At the top of this post, I talked about misconceptions about the vaccines. While there are many misconceptions, the only *specific* misconception I want to talk about now goes something like this: "I'm young and healthy and COVID-19 doesn't affect people like me so I don't need to get the vaccine."

If you find yourself saying something like this, you have a misconception about vaccines. That's okay. Let me repeat that: *It's okay.* But be prepared to feel a bit uncomfortable because you are about to find out that you were misunderstanding something. And remember: when you understand the facts, it's good to change your mind!

So here it is: **It does not matter if you aren't worried about getting sick from COVID-19.** As you will see illustrated in this video **one of the main purposes of vaccines is to protect others from getting sick.** If you don't get the vaccine because you aren't worried about getting sick, you have to understand that you are potentially harming others. Getting a vaccine protects you *and* others from getting sick. And keep in mind that some people are unable to get the vaccine because of health conditions - and those people *really* need our help. The longer it takes for enough people to get vaccinated, the more likely people will continue to get harmed by the virus.

Watch how this video illustrates this idea with ping-pong balls and mousetraps.

[Take a moment to post on this Padlet about something you learned from this post.](https://padlet.com/MNCA/wjlmsbqlbc4pa5ap) What questions do you still have about the vaccines? What did you find interesting or confusing? I hope you found this post interesting all on its own. But if you'd like a little extra motivation, I will grant you extra credit by posting to the Padlet. (If you'd rather send me a [WebMail](https://www.connexus.com/webmail?hideHeader=true/#/composemessage?idWebuser=2786770) than post on the Padlet, you can do that as well.)

I hope you enjoyed Biology class this year. I hope you feel a little more informed and ready to bash misconceptions, lies, and misinformation when you come across them. And I hope you have a wonderful and safe summer.
