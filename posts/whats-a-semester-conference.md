As we mentioned in our [welcome message](/posts/welcome-to-biology-b!/), **all students are required to talk to one of the Biology teachers at least once during the semester**.

### *"How do I know if I still need to complete my Semester Conference?"*

Look at the top of your gradebook in Biology. If the *Semester Conference* item says *grade* or *0*, then you need to complete it. If you aren't sure, just send one of us a quick message in WebMail.

### *To complete your Semester Conference, [book a meeting to meet with any of the Biology teachers.](/contact/)*

### More Info about the Semester Conference

If we ask you to sign up for a Semester Conference, this means we haven't had a chance to speak with you 1 on 1 yet this semester.

In a Semester Conference, you might work with a Biology teacher to make quiz corrections, get help with a portfolio, work on a short activity, or just chat about what we have learned about this semester. 

In Biology class, **a Semester Conference is just between teachers and students. There's no requirement for parents or caretakers.** Of course, if your parent or caretaker would like to speak with us, they are always welcome to.

[Please book a meeting now if you need to complete your Semester Conference](/contact/). You can choose any of the Biology teachers!
