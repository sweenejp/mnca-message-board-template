Biology Policies:

**Late Work**: There are no late penalties, but all  assignments are due at the end of the semester. Temporary zeros for late work will go in at midterm, and two weeks before the semester ends. These zeros are replaced with a score once you complete the assessment. 



**Quiz retakes:** All quizzes can be made up one of two ways:

1. Taking the Alternative Quiz for that lesson on the [message board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/#) (Click quizzes on the side to find them). Each quiz is labelled under the same unit and chapter as it would be on connexus.
2. Webmail one of the Biology teachers and ask for quiz/ test corrections. For each question fill out this form: [Quiz Retake Form](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-do-quiztest-corrections/)



**Portfolios:** All portfolio’s can be found on the [message board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/#). Click portfolio on the side to bring up all posts with Portfolios. 

**All Portfolios can be corrected**. Feedback for corrections are found by [clicking on the score in the gradebook.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-see-feedback/)

To send in corrections, you will need to webmail it as an attachment to the appropriate teacher. That teacher is listed on the portfolio post. [How to send an attachment.](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-send-a-webmail-with-an-attachment/)



**Tests:** All tests are taken on the [message board](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/#). Click Test on the side to bring up all posts with Tests. [Test corrections](https://mnca-biology-message-board.netlify.app/posts/how-to-do-quiztest-corrections/) are done through the same method as the quiz retakes.
