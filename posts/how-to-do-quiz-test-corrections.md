All quizzes can be made up two ways:

1. Taking the [Alternative Quiz](/tags/alternative%20quizzes/) for that lesson on the Message Board. Each quiz is labelled under the same unit and chapter as it would be on connexus.
2. You can do quiz/test corrections using the steps below.

For any points missed on a test or quiz, please use the following format to submit corrections. In a webmail to your teacher, please let us know the name of the assessment you are submitting corrections for. Then, include the following:

* Number you got wrong
* What the correct answer is
* 1-2 sentences explaining why that is the correct answer
* Where you found this information (book page number, lesson and slide number, etc). 

You may submit this for each question you missed.
