Hello Biology students!

## The Unit 1 Test

Remember that the Unit 1 Test is not in Connexus. It is right here on the Message Board. Once you have finished Unit 1, remember to take the [Unit 1 Test](/posts/unit-1-test/)!

## The Unit 1 Portfolio Assignment

If you need help with the [Unit 1 Portfolio](/posts/unit-1-portfolio-mitosis-vs-meiosis/), you can [book a meeting](/contact/) with a Biology teacher. You can also book a meeting if you'd like to work on revisions.

## The Biology Word Wall

The [Biology Word Wall](/posts/the-biology-word-wall/) has been growing thanks to many of you! It still needs a lot more work though. Some slides need images, some need links added to related words.

As always, reach out to a Biology teacher if you have questions about anything.
