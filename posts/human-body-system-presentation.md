**Introduction:**

The human body is composed of several interrelated systems which are in turn composed of cells, tissues, and organs that act independently and interdependently within the body. Each of these components act as a part of a given system that interacts with other systems to provide the metabolic processes needed to maintain life. 

**Your job:** 

Create a presentation of one of the Human Body Systems you learned about in Unit 4. Use Google Slides, Microsoft Powerpoint, or something else (let us know if you have a different idea for creating a presentation).

## **[You can click here to use a template to help you get started!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18pH6lsJKj4mNgdzNG-Zz_821J3Z_BMuFKXJiojuKwpM/edit?usp=sharing)**

**Your presentation should:**

1. Describe the structures and functions of your system. How do the cells, tissues, and organs that make up this system help to do its job?
2. Explain the relationship of your organ system to one other organ system. Example: How does the circulatory system interact with the respiratory system? (You can use any of the 11 body systems to relate your system to.)
3. Describe a disease associated with your system. Include:

   * Causes 
   * Symptoms
   * Treatments
