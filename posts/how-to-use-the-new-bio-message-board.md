We tried to make the new Biology Message Board as simple and easy to navigate as possible so that there is less head scratching when searching for quizzes, tests, or portfolio assignments.

Here is a quick guide to our new Message Board:

### Important Posts

The most important posts are at the top of the [home page](/). You should always make sure you are up to date with the important posts.

### Find contact info

You can find all of the Biology teachers' contact info on the [contact page](/contact/). You can also read more about each teacher by clicking on their contact card.

### Find resources with "tags"

You can easily find posts that you are looking for by navigating with tags. You can see all posts that have to do with Unit 1, for example. You can see all of the portfolios by clicking on the "portfolios" tag, you can find all the alternative quizzes by clicking on the "alternative quizzes" tag, and so forth.

You can see all the tags on the sidebar or on the [tags page](/tags). You can also see which tags each post is tagged with on each individual post.

### Find resources with the search button

You can also find resources with the search button at the top of each page. Try searching for "portfolios", for example.

### How often should I check the Message Board?

Frequently. At least once a week. Also, remember that each lesson in Biology will have a helpful post that goes along with it! These will often include helpful videos (so you might want to stop by here everyday). You can find all of these posts under the ["Lessons" tag](/tags/lessons/).
