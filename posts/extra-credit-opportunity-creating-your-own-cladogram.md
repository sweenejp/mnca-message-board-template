Here are three animals.

1. A squirrel

2. A gibbon

3. An aye aye

Which of these animals do you think are evolutionarily most closely related? That is, which two of these three animals have the most recent common ancestor?

Even though the squirrel and the aye aye kind of look similar, the gibbon and the aye aye have a more recent common ancestor.

Here is what the cladogram ([for a review on cladograms - see the bottom of this post](/posts/modern-evolutionary-classification-unit-2-lesson-14/)) of these three animals would look like:

Notice how the red dots represent the most recent common ancestor of those animals. The most recent common ancestor of gibbons and aye ayes lived about 65 million years ago. The most recent common ancestor of all three of them lived about 90 million years ago. 

## Extra credit opportunity

Create your own cladogram with a minimum of 5 different organisms (more if you'd like!). You can use computer software or draw out your cladogram by hand.

Here are some other important things to consider:

* Use this interactive tree of life explorer called [onezoom.org](https://www.onezoom.org/life.html/@=304358?img=best_any&anim=flight#x989,y424,w0.2386) to help you figure out the relationships between organisms.
* See [here for a tutorial on how to use onezoom.org](https://www.onezoom.org/)
* Remember you can use any 5 (or more) organisms that you want. Have fun exploring how  they are related.
* Give a description of the common ancestor. If possible, give a description of the shared characteristics of organisms that share that common ancestor.
* Create the the cladogram on your computer or on paper. Send your final product as an attachment in WebMail to Mr. Sweeney.
* One last hint: use the "advanced search (tracer) mode on onezoom.org to help you find how different organisms are related
