Lesson 8 briefly discusses two tools that scientists use to be able to analyze DNA. Remember, we can't see DNA directly. So we have to use creative ways in order to study it.

Gel electrophoresis is a technique that separates DNA strands of different lengths. Since different genes are different lengths, this is a useful way to compare genes between individuals.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an amazingly genius way to amplify (make more of) the amount of any particular gene. Again, since DNA is small, it can be very useful to make many millions of copies of a gene in order to better study it. In fact, [PCR is an important tool for COVID-19 tests](https://time.com/5880255/covid-19-tests-types/). 

Your lessons don't go into too much detail about these two processes. You certainly aren't required to learn more about PCR and gel electrophoresis. But for those of you who are interested (maybe you are interested in police forensics, for example), Khan Academy has two excellent videos that explains in detail how each technique works.
