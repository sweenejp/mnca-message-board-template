Food is fuel! People who say that can be a little annoying, I know. But it is true. The molecules in food end up powering everything that goes on in your cells, much like gasoline powers a car.

Furthermore, the things in food are the same things that make up you. Said more sciencey - the molecules that make up food are what eventually get incorporated into your cells. After all, cells are made up of different combinations of carbohydrates, lipids (fats), proteins, and nucleic acids. All of those things are found in food! Of course, that makes sense because food - whether it comes from a plant, animal, or fungus - was at one point also a living thing! Eating is just taking the molecules from another living thing and making them your own.
