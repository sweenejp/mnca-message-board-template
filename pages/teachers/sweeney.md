Hello!

I am Mr. Sweeney. What do I love about Biology, you ask? It's a messy science - which is what makes it fun. There aren't always perfect answers for everything in Biology. And there is still so much that scientists are learning every day about living things.

An important note! Sometimes it can feel like you are working all on your own in an online school. But don't forget that you have teachers! **Always feel free to reach out to me if you have questions. I will always make time to help explain a difficult concept in Biology if you are feeling stuck.**

### More about Mr. Sweeney

Ask me about my favorite books, my favorite places to go camping, and my favorite things to cook! I also like to play volleyball (although not much recently, unfortunately) and learn about computer languages. 

When I'm not reading, camping, cooking, playing volleyball, or teaching Biology, I am hanging out with my family. Here are a couple pictures of my son (Isaac) and my dog (Remus).
